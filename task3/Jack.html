  <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
  <p>Jack would really like...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Roller blades</li>
    <li>Magic tricks</li>
    <li>Anything Pokémon</li>
    <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular one are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2255956">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">eToys.</a></p>
